# styledShopPage
All products available in the store are hard coded.
The project aims for me to practice creating a nice and responsive website and use external library. The application allows to filter the available items by their attributes.
Some of the buttons do not work, due to the lack of backend.


## Used in this project:
- react+nextjs
- styled-components
- framer-motion
- redux
